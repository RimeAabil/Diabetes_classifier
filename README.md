# KNN Classifier Project

### Overview

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using a dataset to perform supervised learning classification. The model predicts class labels based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors.

### Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization

- Implementation of KNN from scratch or using scikit-learn

- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics

- Hyperparameter tuning (choice of k value)

### Dataset
Pima Indians Diabetes Database (available on Kaggle.com)
